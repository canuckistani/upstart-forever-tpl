# Upstart / Forever Script generator

Got an ubuntu server & some node services to run? Run this script and get a nice upstart config to use for this.

Based on this [recipe](http://www.exratione.com/2013/02/nodejs-and-forever-as-a-service-simple-upstart-and-init-scripts-for-ubuntu/).

Usage:

new-service -d <appdir> -n <name>
